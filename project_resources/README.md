#### advancing_project 
For time limitations (in office 3.5 days at current job and brother was playing in the Frozen Four Thursday night) I utilized this
application as a testing grounds. It contains more features but is not working fully yet. Main issue is complexity as I wanted this
to be a single page application to limit http requests. Redux will be added to utilize Provider and ConfigureStore.
